# come in as a "labelled" class

# to see/use the labels, you can "coerce"
# these labelled variables into factors
# using the as_factor() function in haven

# racegrp is a character variable
# which works fine for table
# but still need as_factor() for plot

# to make a simple table using rmarkdown
